# subs_renamer
Simple python script that renames subs files with the same name of their corresponding videos.

# instructions
Put the script in the same folder where you have the subs and their respective videos and just run it. It might take few seconds until it's finished.
It is important to mention that the only files that need to be in that folder are the videos and their subs. This means that if there are 4 videos and 3 subs, or 3 videos and 4 subs, the script will crash.
